a function that takes a list of strings, 
and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
1. use ''.join(string) to concatenate all items in the list

a function that takes a list of integers, 
and returns a new list with every other element from the original list, 
starting with the first element
1. assign a new list to old list using slicing with step set to 2

a function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. 
For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', 
the function should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). 
If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return None
1. Set iterator to 0
2. Iterate through the string
3. if current letter == target letter, increment iterator by 1
4. if iterator reaches 3, get index of current letter
5. else: return none

a function that takes two lists of numbers and returns the result of merging the lists. 
The elements of the first list should become the elements at 
the even indexes of the returned list, 
while the elements of the second list should become the elements at the odd indexes.
You may assume that both list arguments have the same number of elements.
1. Create iterator for list1
2. Create iterator for list2
3. initialize empty list
4. while loop until iterators are both == length of the two lists
5. append element 0 of list2 to element 0 of new list
6. increment list2 iterator
7. append element 0 of list1 to element 1 of new list
8. increment list1 iterator
